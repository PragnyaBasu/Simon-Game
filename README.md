## SIMON GAME

The Simon game is a classic memory and sequence game that challenges players to recall and replicate a series of colored lights and sounds. Here's a detailed description of how it typically works and how it can be implemented using advanced JavaScript techniques:

Game Overview
Objective:
The objective of Simon is to correctly repeat an increasingly long sequence of lights and sounds.

Game Components:

Game Board: Usually consists of four colored buttons (red, green, blue, and yellow).
Sequence Display: Lights up the buttons in a specific order which the player must memorize and replicate.
Sound Effects: Each button has a unique sound that plays when it lights up, aiding in the memorization process.
Score Counter: Keeps track of how many sequences the player has successfully completed.
How to Play
Start the Game: The game begins by lighting up one of the four buttons randomly.
Player's Turn: The player must press the button that lit up.
Sequence Progression: Each round, the game adds one more button to the sequence.
Repeating the Sequence: The player must replicate the entire sequence in the correct order.
Increasing Difficulty: The sequence gets progressively longer, making it more challenging to remember.
Game Over: If the player presses a button out of sequence, the game ends.
